    "detail" : "Do you remember the photo with Thai people posing with French log Alp cabins in a pine forest? It is here. This pine forest reserve has a 50-year history, and it is mainly used as a retreat area for fresh and cool air. The more or less stylish cabins that come in different designs usually require very early bookings, especially for weekends or national holidays. But you can go camping in Doi Bo Luang as well. It is inexpensive and gratifying."
